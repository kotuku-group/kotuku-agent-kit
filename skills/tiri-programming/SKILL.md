# Tiri Programming

Use this skill before changing `.tiri` files or advising on Tiri code. Tiri is a LuaJIT-based language with
project-specific syntax, runtime behaviour, API bindings, typing, and testing conventions.

## First Steps

1. Check for `references/tiri-reference/book.adoc` and `references/wiki/Tiri-Reference-Manual.md`. If either is
   absent, run
   `origo <skill-directory>/scripts/fetch_reference.tiri --log-warning`, using the directory containing this
   `SKILL.md` as `<skill-directory>`. This refreshes the shared wiki and downloads the manual when needed, using the
   configured source repositories. If the download fails, continue with this skill and nearby project examples when
   they provide enough evidence for the task. State that the detailed references are unavailable, and do not guess
   about behaviour that requires them.
2. Read nearby existing `.tiri` files before editing. For new tests, read at least three existing Flute tests first.
3. Prefer current project examples over assumptions from Lua:
   - `examples/*.tiri` for applications and GUI usage
   - `scripts/gui/*.tiri` for widget and layout patterns
   - `scripts/*.tiri` for standard library APIs
   - `tools/*.tiri` for file, process, and utility scripts
   - `tools/idl/idl-c.tiri` for extensive file I/O and API usage
4. Consult the downloaded manual under `references/tiri-reference` and the bundled focused guides under
   `references/wiki` for details that are not summarised here. Read `references/documentation-map.md` to choose the
   smallest relevant source.
5. For Kōtuku module and object APIs, use the `kotuku-api` skill bundled alongside this one. Its downloaded XML
   documentation is under `../kotuku-api/references/docs/xml/modules`.
6. Deal with uncertainty over language and API behaviour by running `origo` with the `--statement` option to run
   micro tests.

## Core Rules

- Tiri scripts use `.tiri` and execute top-to-bottom with no entry point function.
- `.lua` files may also be parsed as Tiri; use `-- $TIRI` near the start when a file needs explicit recognition.
- Script named arguments are read with `arg(Name, Default)`. Argument values arrive as strings.
- Variables and functions are local by default and scoped to their statement block. Use `global` before first use
  only when a symbol must be exported. Use `local` to manage the scope of local variables.
- Use upper camel-case for function arguments and lower snake-case for local variables.
- Use three spaces for indentation.
- Use zero-based indexing for tables and string functions.
- Prefer arrays for sequential data. Arrays are a distinct, typed, JIT-friendly container.
- The Tiri object interface is case sensitive. Object fields are lower snake-case, for example `netlookup.hostName`.
- Tiri uses `is` instead of `==`. Avoid deprecated `==` and `~=`.
- Use `!=` for not-equal.
- Use `try-except-when`, `checkall`, `check`, and `raise` instead of deprecated `pcall()` and `xpcall()`.
- Use `load()` instead of `loadstring()`, `loadFile()` instead of `dofile()`, and result masks instead of `select()`.
- Lua `package`, `os`, and introspective `debug` library assumptions often do not apply; use Kotuku APIs.

## Syntax Differences From Lua

Recognise and use these Tiri extensions where they match local code style:

- `continue` in loops
- `has` for bit flag checks, equivalent to `flags & mask != 0`
- Compound operators: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
- String append: `..=`
- Postfix increment: `++`
- C-style bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
- C-style ternary operator: `condition ? true_val : false_val`
- Falsey checks and defaults: `??`, `??=`, and `value1 ?? value2`
- Nil assignment shorthand: `?=`
- Safe navigation: `obj?.field`, `obj?.method()`, `obj?[key]`
- Deferred cleanup: `defer ... end`
- To-be-closed variables: `resource <close> = acquire_resource()`
- Constants: `local name <const> = value`
- Anonymous function expressions: `(value => print(value))`
- Ranges: `for i in {0 to 10} do`
- The `for` range syntax replaces the Lua `for i=0,10 do` style.
- String interpolation with expressions: `f"My {expression} here"`
- Pipe operator: `value |> transform()` and limited multi-result forwarding with `|N>`
- Result filter operator: `[_*]function_call()` to drop or keep selected return values
- Pattern selection: `choose value from ... end`

Avoid Unicode operator forms in new code unless surrounding code already uses them. ASCII forms are easier for agents,
search tools, and mixed editor environments.

## Typing And Scope

- Local variables use sticky types: the first non-`nil` assignment fixes the variable's type.
- Assigning `nil` clears a value but does not clear its fixed type.
- Use `:any` only when a variable or result genuinely needs mixed types.
- Use parameter and return annotations for public/library functions and recursive functions.
- Supported type names include `any`, `nil`, `num`, `str`, `bool`, `table`, `array`, `func`, `thread`, and `obj`.
- Multi-result return annotations use angle brackets, for example `function split(Line: str):<str, str>`.
- Recursive and mutually recursive functions require explicit return types.
- Use `_` as the blank identifier to intentionally discard assignment, return, or loop values. It cannot be read.

## Control Flow And Errors

- Prefer `try ... except ... when ... success ... end` for structured exception handling.
- `try` catches exceptions but does not promote returned `ERR` values. Use `checkall ... end` for automatic checking of
  supported direct native calls, or `check` for one expression.
- `checkall` does not catch exceptions and does not propagate checking into called Tiri functions.
- Put filtered `except e when ERR_Name` handlers before any catch-all `except e` handler.
- Use `try<trace>` only when stack traces are needed; normal `try` avoids trace overhead.
- Use `check` with API calls returning `ERR` codes, and `raise ERR_Name` for explicit error-code exceptions.
- Use `raise Message` for generic script exceptions and `raise ERR_Name, Message` for coded exceptions with a custom
  message.  In expression branches, use the non-returning `raise(Value)` or `raise(Code, Message)` form.
- Use bare `raise` in an `except` handler to rethrow the current exception while preserving its code, message, source,
  line, trace and stackTrace data.  Bare rethrow is invalid outside the handler's lexical function, including in nested
  functions.
- The global `error()` built-in has been removed.  Its `Level` argument has no `raise` equivalent, and `raise` is
  not first-class; wrap it in an ordinary function when an API requires a failure callback.
- There is no `finally`; use `defer`, `<close>`, or object lifetime management for cleanup.
- `defer` executes on normal scope exit, `return`, `break`, and `continue`. `<close>` handlers run before defers.
- `??` treats `nil`, `false`, `0`, `{}` and `""` as empty. Tables and arrays are tested for empty. Standard `or` only
  treats `nil` and `false` as falsey.
- `?!` guards control flow, for example `value ?! return ERR_InvalidInput`.

## Ranges And Collections

- Range literals use `{Start to Stop}` for exclusive stop and `{Start into Stop}` for inclusive stop.
- Range literals support finite fractional bounds and steps, for example `{0 to 1 by 0.2}`.
- Range operands and steps can be general expressions.
- Negative indices in slicing count from the end and preserve `..` exclusive or `...` inclusive stop semantics.
- Ranges can iterate, slice strings/tables/arrays, test membership with `in`, and provide functional methods such as
  `each`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `take`, `any`, `all`, and `find`.
- Use native arrays for sequential data and buffers:
  - `array<type>`, `array<type, size>`, `array<type> { values... }`
  - common element types include `byte`, `int16`, `int`, `int64`, `float`, `double`, `string`, `object`, `struct`,
    `table`, `array`, and `any`
  - useful methods include `push`, `pop`, `clear`, `resize`, `fill`, `insert`, `remove`, `reverse`, `sort`,
    `contains`, `first`, `last`, `find`, `copy`, `getString`, `setString`, `slice`, `concat`, `clone`,
    `each`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `any`, and `all`

## Strings And Regex

- Use the `regex.*` API instead of obsolete Lua pattern helpers such as `string.gsub()`, `string.match()`, and
  `string.gmatch()`.
- Useful string helpers include `alloc`, `cap`, `count`, `decap`, `escXML`, `hash`, `join`, `pop`, `replace`,
  `trim`, `rtrim`, `split`, `startsWith`, `sub`, `endsWith`, and `unescapeXML`.
- Use f-strings for readable formatting. Add `??` fallbacks when interpolating externally sourced values.

Regex uses compiled PCRE-compatible objects. Compile once and reuse; wrap untrusted patterns in `try`.

Available regex signatures:

```lua
rx = regex.new(Pattern, [Flags])
escaped = regex.escape(Text)
result = rx.test(Text, [RMATCH])
start, stop, captures = rx.findFirst(Text, [Offset], [RMATCH])
iter = rx.findAll(Text, [Offset], [RMATCH])
capture, ... = rx.extract(Text, Offset, [RMATCH])
matches = rx.match(Text, [RMATCH])
all_matches = rx.search(Text, [RMATCH])
result = rx.replace(Text, Replacement, [RMATCH])
parts = rx.split(Text, [RMATCH])
```

Regex compile flags: `regex.ICASE`, `regex.MULTILINE`, `regex.DOT_ALL`.

Regex match/replace flags: `regex.NOT_BEGIN_OF_LINE`, `regex.NOT_END_OF_LINE`, `regex.NOT_BEGIN_OF_WORD`,
`regex.NOT_END_OF_WORD`, `regex.NOT_NULL`, `regex.CONTINUOUS`, `regex.PREV_AVAILABLE`,
`regex.REPLACE_NO_COPY`, `regex.REPLACE_FIRST_ONLY`.

Regex object properties: `pattern`, `flags`, and `error`.

## Scripts, Modules, And Objects

- Use `include 'core','xml','display'` to load API definitions when needed.
- Use top-level `import 'name' [as namespace]` for parse-time inlined libraries. Do not include `.tiri` in imports.
- Use `import './local_name'` for application-specific libraries in the local folder.
- Use `@if(imported=true)` and `@if(imported=false)` to separate library-import behaviour from direct execution.
- Use `loadFile(Path)` only when runtime loading is required; it does not get parse-time inlining benefits.
- Use `exec(Statement)` for dynamic statements and expect parse/runtime failures to raise exceptions.
- Declare modules at compilation-unit level with `module name as mName`; common namespaces are `mAudio`, `mSys`,
  `mGfx`, `mFont`, `mNet`, `mVec`, and `mXML`. Guard optional modules with `@if(exists='modules:name')`.
- Module and object API calls often return `ERR` as the first result; use `check`, result filters, or explicit
  handling rather than ignoring error codes accidentally.
- Create objects with `obj.new('Class', { field=value })` when fields are known up front; this initialises the
  object automatically and raises on error.
- If fields must be set in stages, call `obj.new('Class')`, assign fields, then call `object.init()`.
- Use `obj.find(NameOrUID)` to access existing objects; it returns `nil` if not found.
- Use `local resource <close> = obj.new(...)` for deterministic native-object ownership.  Scope exit follows the
  same destructive path as `resource.free()`, including for detached wrappers returned by `obj.find()`.
- Use `with object do ... end` only to lock Kotuku objects for thread-safe and faster repeated field access; it never
  frees the object.  `array<obj>` is a reference container, so closing an array does not close its elements.
- Child objects created through `parent.new(...)` follow parent lifetime and are weakly referenced.
- Prefer clearing object references to `nil` over manual `free()` unless weak references or immediate termination
  require deterministic `<close>` ownership or an explicit `free()`.
- Actions use the `ac` prefix, methods use the `mt` prefix, and fields are direct properties. Consult generated API
  docs for class-specific names.
- Use `subscribe()`/`unsubscribe()` for action and method subscriptions and clean up subscriptions when finished.

## Async, Processing, And Events

- `async.script(Statement, Callback)` runs code in a separate script state. It cannot see caller variables directly;
  find shared objects with `obj.find()`.
- `async.action(Object, Action, Callback, Key, Args...)` and `async.method(...)` run object calls in a thread. Keep
  the target object alive until the callback runs.
- Async callbacks run on the next message processing cycle, so scripts commonly call `processing.sleep()`.
- Use `processing.sleep([Timeout], [WakeOnSignal=true])` for passive wait loops and event-driven examples.
- Use `processing.new({ timeout=..., signals={...} })` when coordinating multiple signal objects.
- Use `processing.delayedCall(Function)` to schedule work for the next message processing cycle.
- Use `subscribeEvent(EventName, Function)` and `unsubscribeEvent(Handle)` for system-wide events.

## Annotations And Tests

- Function annotations use `@Name(args...)` immediately before a function declaration.
- Use `@Doc(text=[[...]])` when writing library functions that should surface documentation through tooling.
- Compile-time preprocessing uses `@if(condition=value) ... @end`; common conditions are `imported`, `debug`,
  `platform`, and `exists`.
- Flute recognises `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll`, `@Disabled`, and `@Requires`.
- `@Requires` can declare runtime needs such as `display`, `network`, `audio`, `font`, and `ssl`.

## Running Scripts

Run scripts with the project's configured `origo` executable, normally found on `PATH`. When invoking `origo`
directly, include logging:

```powershell
origo --statement "print('Hello')" --log-warning
```

If changing files under `scripts/`, make sure the modified source tree overrides installed scripts:

```powershell
origo path/to/script.tiri --set-volume scripts=/absolute/path/to/kotuku/scripts --log-warning
```

Use `--log-api` for more detail and `--log-threads` when debugging thread-related issues.

## Flute Tests

Always write Tiri tests using Flute unless instructed otherwise. Test files are typically named `test_*.tiri`.

Run a focused test from the repository root with:

```powershell
build/agents-install/origo tools/flute.tiri file=src/network/tests/test_bind_address.tiri --log-warning
```

Use `--gfx-driver=headless` for CI or automated display tests. If running outside the repository root, use an
absolute path for the `file=` parameter.

Register new tests through the existing CMake `flute_test()` pattern in the relevant module.
